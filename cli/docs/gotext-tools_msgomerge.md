## gotext-tools msgomerge

Merges two Uniforum style .po files together.

### Synopsis

Merges two Uniforum style .po files together.  
The def.po file is an existing PO file with translations which will be
taken over to the newly created file as long as they still match;
comments will be preserved, but extracted comments and file positions will
be discarded.
The ref.pot file is the last created PO file with up-to-date source references but
old translations, or a PO Template file (generally created by xgettext);
any translations or comments in the file will be discarded, however dot
comments and file positions will be preserved.
Where an exact match cannot be found, fuzzy matching is used to produce better results.

### Options

```
  -n, --add-location string   Generate ‘#: filename:line’ lines (default).
                              
                              The optional type can be either ‘full’, ‘file’, or ‘never’. 
                              If it is not given or ‘full’, it generates the lines with both
                              file name and line number. If it is ‘file’, the line number part is omitted.
                              If it is ‘never’, it completely suppresses the lines (same as --no-location). (default "full")
      --color string          use colors and other text attributes if WHEN.

  -C, --compendium strings    additional library of message translations,
                              may be specified more than once

      --no-wrap               do not break long message lines, longer than

  -o, --output-file string    write output to specified file
                              The results are written to standard output if no output file is specified
                              or if it is -. (default "-")
  -U, --update                update def.po,
